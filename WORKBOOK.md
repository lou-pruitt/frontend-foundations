Copilot Context — Read Only

This repository is a beginner-first, documentation-driven learning project.

Constraints:
- Content must be sequential. Do not suggest skipping steps or reordering sections.
- Assume the reader has zero prior coding experience.
- Favor clarity, reassurance, and explanation over completeness or efficiency.
- Avoid frameworks, build tools, abstractions, or advanced patterns.
- Avoid jargon unless it is introduced and explained gently.
- Do not optimize for speed, performance, or “best practices” beyond fundamentals.
- Treat AI as a mentor that explains concepts, not an authority or code generator.

Intent:
This workbook teaches how to learn front-end development calmly and safely.
Any suggestion that increases cognitive load, assumes prior knowledge, or
prioritizes output over understanding is out of scope.

# Frontend Foundations — Workbook

Welcome to **Frontend Foundations**.

This workbook is a **sequential, beginner-first guide** to learning front-end web
development from zero experience. It is designed to be followed **in order**.

We assume no prior knowledge. Every concept, tool, and decision is introduced
intentionally and explained clearly.

If something feels confusing, that is normal. We will revisit ideas multiple
times as your understanding grows.

---

## How to Use This Workbook

- Follow the steps **in order**
- Do not skip ahead
- Take your time
- Ask questions
- Verify what you see in the browser
- Modify examples and observe what changes

This workbook uses AI tools (such as ChatGPT) as **mentors**, not authorities.
You are encouraged to question, test, and reflect at every step.

## Step 0 — What We Are Building and Why

We know that learning something new can feel uncertain, especially when it comes to technology. That’s why we created this workbook — to give you a gentle, step-by-step introduction to how websites are made and how the web works.

Our goal is to help you understand the basics of building for the web, starting from the very beginning. We believe that everyone deserves a clear and welcoming path, no matter their background or experience.

As you move through these pages, you’ll find that we focus on understanding, not memorization or speed. We want you to feel safe, supported, and confident as you discover how the web is built. Together, we’ll explore the basics, one step at a time, always making sure you know not just what to do, but why it matters.

**Purpose**

- Understand what front-end web development is
- Understand what a website actually is
- Set expectations for the learning journey

**Outcome**

- You know what problems front-end developers solve
- You understand what this workbook will and will not cover

### What a Website Is (at a High Level)

Before we begin installing tools or creating files, it is important to clarify what we mean by a *website*.

At its most basic level, a website is **a collection of files** that a computer program called a *browser* (such as Chrome or Safari) knows how to read and display.

These files describe:
- What content exists, such as text or images
- How that content is arranged
- How it should look
- How it may respond to interaction

When you visit a website, your browser:
1. Receives these files
2. Interprets the instructions inside them
3. Displays the result on your screen

Nothing more mysterious is happening.

A website is not:
- A single page
- A single language
- A single program running by itself

Instead, it is a cooperation between:
- Files written by people
- Rules understood by browsers
- Actions taken by users, such as clicking, scrolling, and typing

Front-end development focuses on the part of this system that lives **inside the browser** — the part the user sees, touches, and experiences directly.

As you continue through this workbook, you will learn how different kinds of files work together to form a website. For now, it is enough to remember this:

> A website is a set of instructions that tells a browser what to show and how to behave.

You will soon begin writing those instructions yourself — slowly, intentionally, and with full understanding of each step.

In the next step, we will prepare a simple environment so you can begin working with these ideas directly.

## Closing

You are not expected to understand everything immediately.

Learning front-end development is not about memorization.
It is about **recognition, repetition, and confidence**.

If you reached this point, you have already done something difficult:
you stayed.
