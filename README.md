# Frontend Foundations

Frontend Foundations is a **beginner-first, sequential workbook** for learning
front-end web development from **zero experience**.

This project is designed for people who have never written code before and want
a calm, clear, and trustworthy path into web development using modern tools and
responsible AI assistance.

The workbook emphasizes understanding, verification, and gradual confidence
building over speed or memorization.

## Who This Is For

- People with **no prior coding experience**
- Learners who feel lost after trying tutorials
- Career switchers and self-directed beginners
- Anyone who wants to understand how web development actually works

No assumptions are made about prior knowledge.

## What This Project Is (and Is Not)

**Frontend Foundations is:**

- Sequential and step-by-step
- Focused on fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Beginner-safe and intentionally paced
- Designed to be followed in order
- Built using free and open-source tools

**Frontend Foundations is not:**

- A framework tutorial
- A bootcamp replacement
- A shortcut to advanced topics
- A copy-paste code generator

## Project Principles

Frontend Foundations is built around a small set of non-negotiable principles
designed to protect beginners, ensure clarity, and keep the project focused.

These principles guide all decisions about scope, content, tooling, and
contributions.

## Learning Approach

This project uses a **prompt-driven learning model** supported by AI tools such
as ChatGPT.

AI is treated as a **mentor**, not an authority. Learners are encouraged to:

- Ask questions
- Verify answers
- Modify examples
- Reflect on what they observe

Blind copy-paste without understanding is explicitly discouraged.

## Project Status

**Current phase:** Private incubation (Phase 0)

- The workbook structure is under active development
- Content is not yet ready for public contributions
- Scope and pedagogy are being finalized

The project will be opened to contributors only after the first complete
learning loop has been validated.

## License

License information will be added before the project enters the open
contribution phase.
